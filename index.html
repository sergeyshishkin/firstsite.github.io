	<h1>Training journal</h1>
	<p class="title">Initial post</p>
    <p>Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and computer science in general.
    <br>I'll try to write about every step and pauses that occure.
    <br>Current datetime is 8th of October 2021, 9:12 pm, RCHP - This Velvet Glove is playing.
	<br>Today I've started to read a book called "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"
	<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">link</a>.
	<br>Also, I set up a repository for my practical tasks <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/python-practice">link</a></p>
	
	<p class="title">Diving in</p>
	<p>Realized that without practice and some tangible result I may lose any motivation to learn.
	<br>I've already faced this earlier, during my prevoius attemtps.
	<br>In purpose of eliminating the risk factor, I decided to develop a web app.
	<br>During that I'm will get some practical experience and theoretical knowledge.
	<br>Here is a repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/flask_app">link</a> details in repo description.
	<br>It's a step-by-step tutorial, so I'll complete it fast. 
	<br>Main point of that is to have a kickstart. After I will create my own idea of app and gonna develop it

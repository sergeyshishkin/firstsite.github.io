	<h1>Training journal</h1>
	<p class="title">Initial post</p>
    <p>Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and computer science in general.
    <br>I'll try to write about every step that occurred.
    <br>Current datetime is 8th of October 2021, 9:12 pm, RCHP - This Velvet Glove is playing.
	<br>Today I've started to read a book called "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"
	<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">link</a>.
	<br>Also, I set up a repository for my practical tasks <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/python-practice">link</a></p>
	
	<p class="title">Diving in</p>
	<p>Realized that without practice and some tangible result I may lose any motivation to learn.
	<br>I've already faced this earlier, during my prevoius attemtps.
	<br>In purpose of eliminating the risk factor, I decided to develop a web app.
	<br>During that I'm will get some practical experience and theoretical knowledge.
	<br>Here is a repository for this project <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/flask_app">link</a> details in repo description.
	<br>It's a step-by-step tutorial, so I'll complete it fast. 
	<br>Main point of that is to have a kickstart. After I will create my own idea of app and gonna develop it
	</p>

	<p class="title">Facing real life</p>
	<p>As it happens, newbies are unreasonably optimistic fellows.
	<br>During my "diving in" Flask app development, I figured out that have a lack basic knowledge, such as HTML and CSS, not to mention Python.
	<br>So, a paused Flask and started learn HTML and CSS instead. 
	<br>One more "discovery": right after that I need to learn Javascript, so I can something cool in web.
	<br>Two programming languages at a time, especially for a non-tech guy - not recommended.
	<br>Almost forgot, Computer Science is a must-have for anybody in the field.
	<br>Let's sum it up:
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Need to learn HTML and CSS</li>
			<li>Need to know Javascript</li>
			<li>Need to know Python</li>
			<li>Need to know Computer Science</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br>Looks redundantly...So I decided to rearrange it a bit.
	<br>I started up with HTML, CSS. Gonna make up email templates and read/watch tutorial or guides if neccessary.
	<br>Computer Science Harvard course CS50 goes in parallel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLawfWYMUziZqyUL5QDLVbe3j5BKWj42E5">link</a>.
	<br>Then Javascript. As I find out, it can be used for backend development. As my Pyhton knowledge are basic, probably better choose Javascript for now.
	<br>As for Python, will see. There is a lot of stuff to do for now
	</p>

	<p class="title">Doubting</p>
	<p>As it had happened to me before, I started doubting in everything that I commited to, in terms of coding.
	<br> The only thing that helps me to stay on track, is a simple idea: "It's better to spend time on something, then on doubting".
	<br> So, I left email templating and start developing my own idea: promo web site for optics store.
	<br> Here is a <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/Web-site-practice">link</a>
	<br>Sooner or later I want to start dealing with backend. Perhaps it's better to dive into JS stack, in purpose to be able do frontend and backend.

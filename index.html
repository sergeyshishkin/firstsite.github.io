    <h1>Training journal</h1>

    <h3 class="post-name">01. Initial post</h3>
    Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and
    computer science in general. I'll try to write about every step that
    occurred. Current datetime is 8th of October 2021, 9:12 pm, RCHP - This
    Velvet Glove is playing. oday I've started to read a book called "How to
    Think Like a Computer Scientist"
    <a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">link</a>.
    lso, I set up a repository for my practical tasks
    <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/python-practice">link</a>

    <h3 class="post-name">02. Diving in</h3>
    Realized that without practice and some tangible result I may lose any
    motivation to learn. 've already faced this earlier, during my prevoius
    attemtps. n purpose of eliminating the risk factor, I decided to develop a
    web app. uring that I'm will get some practical experience and theoretical
    knowledge. ere is a repository for this project
    <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/flask_app">link</a> details in
    repo description. t's a step-by-step tutorial, so I'll complete it fast. ain
    point of that is to have a kickstart. After I will create my own idea of app
    and gonna develop it

    <h3 class="post-name">03. Facing real life</h3>
    As it happens, newbies are unreasonably optimistic fellows. uring my "diving
    in" Flask app development, I figured out that have a lack basic knowledge,
    such as HTML and CSS, not to mention Python. o, a paused Flask and started
    learn HTML and CSS instead. ne more "discovery": right after that I need to
    learn Javascript, so I can something cool in web. wo programming languages
    at a time, especially for a non-tech guy - not recommended. lmost forgot,
    Computer Science is a must-have for anybody in the field. et's sum it up:
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Need to learn HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Need to know Javascript</li>
        <li>Need to know Python</li>
        <li>Need to know Computer Science</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    Looks redundant...So I decided to rearrange it a bit. started up with HTML,
    CSS. Gonna make up email templates and read/watch tutorial or guides if
    neccessary. omputer Science Harvard course CS50 goes in parallel

    >. hen Javascript. As I find out, it can be used for backend development. As
    my Pyhton knowledge are basic, probably better choose Javascript for now. s
    for Python, will see. There is a lot of stuff to do for now

    <h3 class="post-name">04. Doubting</h3>
    As it had happened to me before, I started doubting in everything that I
    commited to, in terms of coding. The only thing that helps me to stay on
    track, is a simple idea: "It's better to spend time on something, then on
    doubting". So, I left email templating and start developing my own idea:
    promo web site for optics store. Here is a
    <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/Web-site-practice">link</a>
    ooner or later I want to start dealing with backend. Perhaps it's better to
    dive into JS stack, in purpose to be able do frontend and backend.

    <h3 class="post-name">05. Pivot</h3>
    After some days practicing markup with HTML and CSS I found out, that do
    something "business-like" or functional stuff is not what drives me now. I
    want expression, burst of colors, shapes, movement and action. That's why I
    started learning graphical tools, p5.js for now. HTML and CSS also should be
    with me, but for now I want to dive deeper into JS and other tools.
    Currently working on local machine, no contribution to repository.

    <h3 class="post-name">06. Miss me?</h3>
    November 7th, 2022. It's been a while, hah?) So, I've completed JavaScript
    full course Youtube video <a href="https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M">link</a>
    Surely it's not a full course. There are tons of stuff need to know about. I
    even take a look at JS learning roadmap. So, keep on learning and coding :)

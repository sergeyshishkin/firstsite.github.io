	<h1>Training journal</h1>
	<p class="title">Initial post</p>
    <p>Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and computer science in general.
    <br>I'll try to write about every step and pauses that occure.
    <br>Current datetime is 8th of October 2021, 9:12 pm, RCHP - This Velvet Glove is playing.
	<br>Today I've started to read a book called "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist"
	<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/">link</a>.
	<br>Also, I set up a repository for my practical tasks <a href="https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/python-practice">link</a></p>

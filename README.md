# Training journal

Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and computer science in general.
I'll try to write about every step that occurred.

### 01. Initial post

October 9, 2021.
Here is a training journal of my educational process in programming and
computer science in general. I'll try to write about every step that
occurred. Current datetime is 8th of October 2021, 9:12 pm, RCHP - This
Velvet Glove is playing. oday I've started to read a book called "How to
Think Like a Computer Scientist" http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/.
Also, I set up a repository for my practical tasks https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/python-practice (no longer exist)

### 02. Diving in

October 12, 2021.
Realized that without practice and some tangible result I may lose any
motivation to learn. 've already faced this earlier, during my prevoius
attemtps. n purpose of eliminating the risk factor, I decided to develop a
web app. uring that I'm will get some practical experience and theoretical
knowledge. Here is a repository for this project https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/flask_app (no longer exist), details in
repo description. It's a step-by-step tutorial, so I'll complete it fast. Main
point of that is to have a kickstart. After I will create my own idea of app
and gonna develop it

### 03. Facing real life

October 19, 2021.
As it happens, newbies are unreasonably optimistic fellows. uring my "diving
in" Flask app development, I figured out that have a lack basic knowledge,
such as HTML and CSS, not to mention Python. o, a paused Flask and started
learn HTML and CSS instead. ne more "discovery": right after that I need to
learn Javascript, so I can something cool in web. wo programming languages
at a time, especially for a non-tech guy - not recommended. lmost forgot,
Computer Science is a must-have for anybody in the field. Let's sum it up:

- Need to learn HTML and CSS
- Need to know Javascript
- Need to know Python
- Need to know Computer Science

Looks redundant...So I decided to rearrange it a bit. started up with HTML,
CSS. Gonna make up email templates and read/watch tutorial or guides if
neccessary. omputer Science Harvard course CS50 goes in parallel https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLawfWYMUziZqyUL5QDLVbe3j5BKWj42E5
Then Javascript. As I find out, it can be used for backend development. As
my Pyhton knowledge are basic, probably better choose Javascript for now. s
for Python, will see. There is a lot of stuff to do for now

### 04. Doubting

October 29, 2021.
As it had happened to me before, I started doubting in everything that I
commited to, in terms of coding. The only thing that helps me to stay on
track, is a simple idea: "It's better to spend time on something, then on
doubting". So, I left email templating and start developing my own idea:
promo web site for optics store. Here is a https://github.com/sergeyshishkin/Web-site-practice
ooner or later I want to start dealing with backend. Perhaps it's better to
dive into JS stack, in purpose to be able do frontend and backend.

### 05. Pivot

November 15, 2021.
After some days practicing markup with HTML and CSS I found out, that do
something "business-like" or functional stuff is not what drives me now. I
want expression, burst of colors, shapes, movement and action. That's why I
started learning graphical tools, p5.js for now. HTML and CSS also should be
with me, but for now I want to dive deeper into JS and other tools.
Currently working on local machine, no contribution to repository.

### 06. Miss me?

November 7th, 2022.
It's been a while, hah?) So, I've completed JavaScript
full course Youtube video https://youtu.be/jS4aFq5-91M.
Surely it's not a full course. There are tons of stuff need to know about. I
even take a look at JS learning roadmap. So, keep on learning and coding :)
